#Write a program that creates a list with the following integers: 3, 5, 9, 3, 2, 9, 10. The program should iterate through the values in the list and print out each of the integers on separate lines.
list =[3, 5, 9, 3, 2, 9, 10]
for items in list:
    print(items)

#Write a program that creates a tuple with the following strings: "one", "two", "three", "four", "five". The program should print out the length of each string in the tuple on different lines.

tuple =("one","two","three","four","five")
for i in tuple:
